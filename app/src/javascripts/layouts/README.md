This is where we really define the look of the page. We compose the layout from a template, and regions in the template, different modules imported as controllers, events and routers to help controller the flow of the application as we move from layout to layout. Layouts are injected into the root 'layout' region of the index.ejs file and we inject modules into the layouts regions.
