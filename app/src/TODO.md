- [ ] Persist task list changes across all open clients in the same browser (weird, app specific)
- [ ] Pushstate; Remove octothorpe from url (difficult, server mods)
- [x] Early integration of promises w/ controller and view logic
- [ ] Orthogonal state (https://youtu.be/UAl_N62gKmM?t=22m11s)
- [ ] Rethink window.transition global (the router singleton)
- [ ] Rethink "account" custom methods so that it has signin/signout methods
- [ ] Add config object for entire app (debug settings and more)
- [ ] Research and implement testing techniques (boring)
- [x] Fix blur bug on tasks input after adding to list (work around for now)
- [ ] Support more OAuth2 provider and properly brand (easy after next items completes)
- [ ] Fully integrate promises w/ view sync-fetch logic and view event system (difficult, see next items)
- [ ] Enitity promises fire events on views (see next item)
- [x] Deprecate controllers (see next item) (changed mind)
- [ ] Use small functions to instance page views in router definition
- [ ] Mod backbone.localStorage to be used as a cache (cachedFetch(), cachedSync())
- [ ] Cache account (and use special lookups like above)
- [ ] Implement save() on GoogleAccountModel to save to cache
- [ ] Memory leak (not removing views; they are still listening for events!)
- [ ] Page_Model or package.json singelton
- [ ] View registry for mass removal; mem cleanup
- [ ] postRender callback
- [ ] need way to traverse views/controllers via ui when no route is hit
